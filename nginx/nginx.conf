# In this setup, Nginx listens on port 80 and routes requests 
# to the appropriate services based on the location blocks. 
# The configuration assumes that service1 and service2 are the 
# names of the services defined in your docker-compose.yml. 
# Each service is accessible via a path on the gateway 
# (e.g., /service1/ routes to service1).
